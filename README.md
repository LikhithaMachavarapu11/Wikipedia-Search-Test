# 🚀 Objectives

- Automate the Wikipedia search process using Selenium WebDriver.
- Validate that search results load correctly for given keywords.
- Count and print the number of search results as a quick measure of search effectiveness.
- Ensure smooth and accurate browser interaction with dynamic web content.

# 🧠 Key Features

- **Search Automation:** Enters a search term (e.g., “HTML”) and initiates the search automatically.
- **Dynamic Wait Handling:** Waits until the search results are fully loaded before continuing.
- **Result Count Verification:** Counts and prints the total number of search results displayed.
- **Clean Browser Management:** Opens the browser, executes all steps, and closes automatically after the test.
- **Error-Free Execution:** Ensures stable automation without manual intervention.

# ⚙️ How It Works

1. The script launches the browser and navigates to the Wikipedia homepage.
2. It enters the search term (for example, “HTML”) into the search box.
3. The search is initiated and the script waits for the results to load completely.
4. Once loaded, the script counts the number of search result elements on the page.
5. It prints the result count in the console for verification.
6. Finally, the browser window is closed automatically.
