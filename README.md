**Wikipedia Search Test ()**


In this project, I automated a search functionality on a Wikipedia-like platform using Selenium WebDriver and Java. 

Here are the key highlights: 

●	Developed a script to automate the process of entering a search query ("HTML") and initiating the search. 

●	Implemented a mechanism to wait until the search results are fully loaded, ensuring accurate results. 

●	The script is designed to count the number of search results and print the count, providing a quick overview of the search effectiveness. 

●	At the end of the process, the script automatically closes the browser, ensuring clean execution. 

●	This project demonstrated my ability to automate web interactions and handle dynamic content using Selenium WebDriver. 

**Technologies used:** Java, Selenium WebDriver
